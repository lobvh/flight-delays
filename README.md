# flight-delays

This is a pet-project where the challenge is to predict whether a plane is delayed 15 minutes or more (binary classification).  
Dimensionality of dataset is not that big (feature-wise), but it could serve as a nice toy example to practise some things I learn along the way. Target variable is not balanced, and hence serves as a nice toy-example where accuracy might be 'misleading' metric. Some strategies to 'combat' these are proposed, and hence I imagined this as a 'business task' to make learning more meaningful. 

Since this pet-project is ongoing, there will be a lot of improvements (hopefully): preprocessing data, using methodologies and strategies to make predictions and improving the ML algorithms, making simple ML pipelines, using EDA, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction and so on.
